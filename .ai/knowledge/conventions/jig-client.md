# JigClient — the only module that knows Jig

Not built yet: the paths match nothing until the first task writes them.

## Practice

```
JigClient (server/jig/)

MAY:      run `jig` in a project's main checkout; parse and validate its JSON; check the
          project's Jig version
MUST:     use execFile without a shell — on Windows Git's bash running .ai/scripts/jig, never
          jig.cmd; validate every response against the shape its contract test pins; turn a
          refusal into Jig's failure code
MUST NOT: read or write Jig's files directly (`state`, roadmaps, the queue file); call the
          network; let a shape of Jig's output leak past its own types
Why:      a change of Jig's contract must be a change here and in its contract tests only, and
          Jig's files are not a contract Jig promised.
```

## Example

A task-list read runs Jig's JSON task listing, validates the envelope and each row, and returns
typed tasks; a response that fails validation re-checks the project's Jig version and is
reported as "this project's Jig is not supported", never shown half-parsed.
